# api-extractor example

This is a simple sandbox repository to showcase some examples of microsoft api-extractor usage.

!!!The project doesn't work out of the box, api-extractor warnings need to be fixed first (see bellow)!!!

## Usage

`npm run compile` compiles the typescript application

`npm run extract-api` extract the api for the typescript project.

To have this command working without error, you should fix all warning printed into the console.
